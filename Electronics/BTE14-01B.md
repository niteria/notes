Not really a Nano V3. You need CH340 drivers. Ubuntu already has them.

Settings for the Arduino IDE, different from Nano V3:
* Board: Arduino Nano (Arduino Duemilanove or Diecimila also works)
* Processor (important!): ATmega168
* Port: `/dev/ttyUSB0` (check `dmesg:` `[466300.873493] usb 1-3: ch341-uart converter now attached to ttyUSB0`)

I thought it didn't have a bootloader, but I was wrong. I didn't succeed to upload the bootloader anyway.
